# Connected Garden - automate your garden with Alexa and condition sensors
Connected Garden explores an innovative solution for efficient residential garden management for those people with visual disability. Introducing an integrated humidity and sunlight sensor system that, in collaboration with the Alexa voice assistant, offers a revolutionary and inclusive approach to home horticulture. Allowing them to monitor the conditions of their plants in real time and provide precise care, from watering to lighting.


# About
This project uses the Alexa voice assistant as the main component to receive notifications about changes in light or humidity that require action for plant care. An Arduino with sensors collects light and humidity data, sends it through an API, updating a database. The API then communicates the updated status to Alexa, allowing it to inform the user about the status of the plant and any necessary actions.
